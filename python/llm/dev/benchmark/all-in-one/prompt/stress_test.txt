'summarise the following text into bullet points: Ouch. Sounds like you\'re having a tough time max. That sucks. I\'ve been there, so I kinda know what you\'re talking about. I\'ve been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It\'s no bueno. I know. If you don\'t mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don\'t let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you\'re just letting us both down. And you don\'t HAVE to do that. You don\'t HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name’s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it’s a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What\'s a zero day? A zero day is when you don\'t do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I\'m not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that\'s not the point. The point I\'m trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt\' do anything all fucking day and it\'s 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you\'re in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that\'s what you\'re used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn\'t happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That\'s rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU\'S. Uh what? 3 me\'s? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you\'s homeslice. There\'s the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you\'s are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you\'ve done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that\'s all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me\'s is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It\'s future and past you). Tired as hell and can\'t get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one\'s for future me, i\'m gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I\'m doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one\'s for my best friend, the future me. I\'m up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it\'s gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don\'t worry i\'m gonna too long didnt\' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn\'t do it. Now you\'re giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one\'s for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that\'s it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we\'ve all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read "emotional intelligence". Read "From good to great". Read “thinking fast and slow”. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how\'s them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat’s about it man. There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey… I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day ☺\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by "much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it\'s tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It\'s this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I\'ll be oakin\' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you\'re becoming the champion you\'re dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought\'s son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you\'ve steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that\'s a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you\'re like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go.'

The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy.\n\n Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\n Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be.\n\n How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus.\n\n Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths.\n\n It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection.\n\n A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines.\n\n China’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese.\n\n As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives." \n From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n 1. "President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”"\n 2. "A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January."\n 3. "we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus"\n 4.

Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests.\n\n Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours.\n\n All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable.\n\n Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.”\n\n The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it.\n\n Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes.\n\n Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video.\n\n Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour.\n\n Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness.\n\n Vaccines, not voodoo\n\n At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics.\n\n People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up.\n\n But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases.\n\n When the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake."\n\n \nFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n 1.

But, WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said infections were exploding in China well before the government\'s decision to phase out its stringent regime.\n\n "There\'s a narrative at the moment that China lifted the restrictions and all of a sudden the disease is out of control," Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\n\n "The disease was spreading intensively because I believe the control measures in themselves were not stopping the disease."\n\n Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday China has "institutional advantages" to fight COVID.\n\n "We will certainly be able to smoothly get through the peak of the epidemic," he told a regular news briefing in response to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby saying that the United States was ready to help if China requested it.\n\n There are increasing signs of chaos during China\'s change of tack - including long queues outside fever clinics, runs on medicines and panic buying across the country.\n\n On Thursday night, China\'s state asset regulator urged state-backed big drugmakers to ensure supplies of COVID-related medicines.\n\n The companies include China Resources, China General Technology and Sinopharm, which own businesses that produce drugs that could ease coronavirus symptoms.\n\n One video posted online on Wednesday showed several people in thick winter clothes hooked up to intravenous drips as they sat on stools on the street outside a clinic in central Hubei province. Reuters verified the location of the video.\n\n The COVID scare in China also led people in Hong Kong, Macau and in some neighbourhoods in Australia to go in search for fever medicines and test kits for family and friends on the mainland.\n\n For all its efforts to quell the virus since it erupted in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China may now pay a price for shielding a population that lacks "herd immunity" and has low vaccination rates among the elderly, analysts said.\n\n "Authorities have let cases in Beijing and other cities spread to the point where resuming restrictions, testing and tracing would be largely ineffective in bringing outbreaks under control," analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Thursday.\n\n "Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months."\n\n Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million. China has reported just 5,235 COVID-related deaths so far, extremely low by global standards.\n\n China\'s stock markets and its currency fell on Thursday on concerns of the virus spread.\n\n China reported 2,000 new symptomatic COVID-19 infections for Dec. 14 compared with 2,291 a day. The official figures, however, have become less reliable as testing has dropped. It also stopped reporting asymptomatic figures on Wednesday.\n\n CONCERN FOR ELDERLY\n\n China, which has said around 90% of its population is vaccinated against COVID, has now decided to roll out the second booster shot for high-risk groups and elderly people over 60 years of age.\n\n National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Wednesday it was necessary to accelerate the promotion of vaccinations, according to comments reported by state media.\n\n The latest official data shows China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots.\n\n Vaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days. The latest official data shows it administered 1.43 million shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000 - 200,000 doses a day.\n\n Vaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days. The latest official data shows it administered 1.43 million shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000 - 200,000 doses a day.\n\n But one Shanghai care home said on Wednesday a number of its residents have not yet been vaccinated and considering their underlying medical condition, it has barred visitors and non-essential deliveries while stockpiling medicines, tests kits and protective gear.\n\n "We are racking our brains on how to ensure the safety of your grandparents," the Yuepu Tianyi Nursing Home wrote in a letter posted on its official WeChat account page.\n\n Beijing has been largely resistant to western vaccines and treatments, having relied on locally-made shots. Pfizer\'s (PFE.N) oral COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid is one of the few foreign ones it has approved.\n\n The treatment, however, has only been available in hospitals for high-risk patients, but signs have appeared in recent days that it may soon be made more widely available.\n\n China Meheco Group Co Ltd\'s stock jumped (600056.SS) after it announced a deal to import the U.S. drugmaker\'s treatment on Wednesday.\n\n ECONOMIC CONFERENCE\n\n As the virus spreads, President Xi, his ruling Politburo and senior government officials began a two-day meeting to plot a recovery for China\'s battered economy, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\n China\'s economy lost more steam in November as factory output growth slowed and retail sales extended declines, both missing forecasts and clocking their worst readings since May, data on Thursday showed.\n\n Economists estimate that China\'s growth has slowed to around 3% this year, marking one of China\'s worst performances in almost half a century."\n\n \nFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n 1. "Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months."\n 2. "Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million."\n 3. "China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots."'
